    <div class="name">The Lotus Temple</div>
    <div class="des">The architect, Fariborz Sahba has attempted to make this building familiar and acceptable to the Indian people without imitating any of the existing architectural schools of India. The basic idea of the design is that two fundamental elements - light and water - have been used as ornamentation in place of the statues and carvings normally found in Indian temples.The structure is composed of three ranks of nine petals each, springing from a podium which elevates the building above the surrounding plain. The first two ranks curve inward, embracing the inner dome, while the third layer curves outward to form canopies over the nine entrances.</div>
